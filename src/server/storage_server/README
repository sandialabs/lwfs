********** Current status for the storage directory **********

Doing 'make' in this directory should generate the storage libraries
libstorage_srvr.la and libstorage_clnt.la as well as the storage server
test executable (ss_test).  libstorage_clnt.la contains the storage
proxy functions for use by the client.  libstorage_srvr.la contains
the basic api functions for the server.  'ss_test' links the two
libraries and makes largely random calls to the storage API (client
side).

Here is the basic outline of ss_test:

    /*      while (we have more objects to create){
     *
     *          1) create an obj or not (random);
     *
     *          2) delete an arbitrary obj or not (random);
     *
     *          3) write or not (random) to an arbitrary
     *             object;
     *
     *          4) read or not (random) from an arbitrary object, 
     *             at an arbitrary index into the file; verify that
     *             data read is correct;
     *
     *     }
     */

The storage server does not do locking, journaling, or
verification of capabilities.

Any logging is to 'log.txt' in the current working directory.
