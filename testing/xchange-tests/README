The xchange-tests program has a single primary option:
testid.  The valid values are as follow:
0 = test the composite file API to create, write, read, and delete a file
1 = test the transform composite file API for the same operations
2 = test the raw API to do the same operations as above.  This is intended
    as a way to determine how to perform various operations and then be
    used as a template to construct the composite operations.
