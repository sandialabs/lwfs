Test the portals PUT and GET calls.  

Executables:
  - hello_world     Transfers "Hello World!" from client to server
  - get_bw_utcp     Bandwidth tests for the get operation
  - put_bw_utcp     Bandwidth tests for the put operation
  - get_pp_utcp     Ping-pong latency tests for the get operation
  - put_pp_utcp     Ping-pong latency tests for the put operation
  - ringtest        Sends a message around in a ring

The easiest way to run these tests is to open one window for each
process and use the portals3 runtime library to assign each process
a separate portals process id.  For example, if you want to run the 
client and server portions of the "get_bw_utcp" test on the same host, 
execute the following:

--- Process 0 ---
% export PTL_IFACE=lo; 
% export PTL_MY_RID=0; 
% export PTL_NIDMAP=`utcp_nid lo:`utcp_nid lo`; 
% export PTL_PIDMAP=98:99;

--- Process 0 ---
% export PTL_IFACE=lo; 
% export PTL_MY_RID=0; 
% export PTL_NIDMAP=`utcp_nid lo:`utcp_nid lo`; 
% export PTL_PIDMAP=98:99;
