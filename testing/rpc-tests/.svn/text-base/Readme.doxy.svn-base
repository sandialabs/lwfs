 /**
 * \mainpage Analysis of LWFS RPC
 *
 * \section Intoduction
 *
 * The experiments in this directory compare the throughput 
 * (measured in MB/sec) of the LWFS RPC mechanism to various 
 * other approaches.  Each experiment consists of two processes: 
 * a client that sends an integer followed by an array of 16-byte 
 * data structures to the server, and a server that receives the 
 * array of 16-byte data structures and returns a single 16-byte
 * data structure to the client. Each 16-byte data structure 
 * (shown below) consists of a 4-byte integer, a 4-byte float, 
 * and a 8-byte double. 
 *
 * \code
 * struct test_data {
 *	 int int_val (4 bytes);
 *	 float float_val  (4 bytes);
 *	 double double_val (8 bytes);
 * }; 
 * 
 * We calculate the throughput with the following equation: 
 * \f[
 *     T=\frac{(4+(n+1)*16)}{t},
 * \f]
 * where \f$T\f$ is the throughput in MB/sec, \f$n\f$ is the size of the 
 * array sent to the server, and \f$t\f$ is the round-trip time for 
 * the operation.
